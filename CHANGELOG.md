## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `copilot-daily` CLI (`uv run copilot-daily [--as-of] [--dry-run]
  [--skip-text] [--skip-llm] [--limit N] [--no-open]`), wiring all nine
  daily-batch steps: price/fundamentals/screening/risk (fatal on
  failure), text collection and LLM analysis (fail-soft, degrade the
  run without aborting it), report generation, Discord notification,
  and local browser auto-open
- `report/html_report.py` + `templates/report.html.j2` +
  `reports/assets/style.css`: the daily Morning Briefing report —
  market strip, risk warnings, ranked candidate table, and per-symbol
  detail cards (TradingView Lightweight Charts v5, fundamentals, risk
  sizing, a fail-soft LLM summary block), written atomically to
  `reports/{run_date}.html` and `reports/latest.html`
- `report/discord_notify.py`: optional Discord webhook notification
  (`notification.enabled`), never raising — a failed send degrades the
  run instead of stopping it
- `paper/journal.py`: paper-trading decision log (idempotent
  `record_decision`), position lifecycle (`close_position`, rejecting a
  missing/already-closed position instead of a silent no-op), and
  `summarize_performance()` (closed-trade P&L/win-rate vs. a SPY
  buy-and-hold benchmark over the same span)
- `MarketStore.get_latest_fundamentals()`, `StateStore.get_position()`/
  `get_closed_positions()`/`record_trade_decision()`/
  `record_text_items()`/`get_source_urls()`: report- and paper-trading-
  oriented storage queries
- Initial project structure
- `scripts/bootstrap.py` deterministic template initializer: renames the
  package and replaces every placeholder (`swing-copilot`, `swing_copilot`,
  `tomada1114`, `tomada`, `tmasuyama1114@gmail.com`) across tracked files
- Python 3.14 support in the CI test matrix and trove classifiers
- `zizmor` security lint for GitHub Actions workflows, wired into both CI
  and pre-commit
- `actions/dependency-review-action` on pull requests
- Weekly `pip-audit` dependency vulnerability scan
- Weekly OpenSSF Scorecard analysis
- PR auto-labeling by Conventional Commit type, so the release changelog
  categories actually populate
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for a ready-to-use dev environment
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` disabling blank issues and linking
  security reports to GitHub Security Advisories
- Dependabot cooldown and `tool.uv.exclude-newer` supply-chain cutoff,
  documented in `.claude/rules/pyproject.md`
- `AGENTS.md` as the canonical, tool-agnostic agent guide (previously a
  symlink to `CLAUDE.md`, which breaks on Windows checkouts)
- `.claude/hooks/guard.py` PreToolUse guard blocking writes to
  `uv.lock`/`.env*`/`secrets/**` (via Edit/Write or shell commands),
  `git commit --no-verify`, and plain force-pushes
- `.claude/hooks/stop_check.py` Stop-hook gate running ruff (lint + format
  check) and mypy before an agent turn ends when Python files changed
- Committed Claude Code permission allowlist covering local build, lint,
  and test commands only — commit/push/PR creation stay behind approval

### Changed

- Moved coverage enforcement (`--cov-fail-under=80`) out of pytest
  `addopts` and into `just test` / CI, so a single test can be run in
  isolation without failing the coverage gate
- Restructured the release pipeline: a dedicated `build` job now builds
  and attests provenance once; `publish` and the GitHub Release both
  consume that artifact instead of rebuilding
- Scoped all workflow permissions to job level, added `timeout-minutes`
  to every job, added `--locked` to every `uv sync` in CI, and disabled
  checkout credential persistence outside the docs deploy job
- Simplified `src/swing_copilot/__init__.py`'s version resolution to the
  standard `importlib.metadata.version()` pattern, dropping the ~50-line
  local-pyproject-walking fallback chain
- Replaced the bespoke `no-commit-to-main` pre-commit hook with the
  pre-commit-hooks builtin `no-commit-to-branch`
- Unified mypy targets (`src scripts tests`) across justfile, CI,
  release, and pre-commit
- Expanded ruff rule set (`D`, `PT`, `N`, `TRY`, `EM`, `DTZ`, `RSE`,
  `PGH`) to match `.claude/rules/python.md`; renamed `TCH` -> `TC`
- The post-edit format hook now formats only the edited Python file and
  surfaces failures to the agent, replacing the repo-wide ruff run that
  suppressed all errors
- `CLAUDE.md` is now a thin `@AGENTS.md` import plus Claude Code
  specifics; `.claude/rules/python.md` no longer restates rules ruff
  already enforces mechanically
- `just fmt` now runs `ruff check --fix` before `ruff format` (ruff's
  recommended order, matching the post-edit hook), so lint autofixes can
  no longer leave formatting drift behind

### Fixed

- `Database.connect()` now forces the DuckDB session `TimeZone` to UTC —
  `TIMESTAMPTZ -> DATE` `as_of` boundary casts previously used the host
  machine's local timezone, which could include or exclude a filing
  near a UTC-midnight boundary depending on where the batch ran
- The price step now also fetches the market strip's fixed index
  symbols (SPY/QQQ/^VIX/^TNX), which are never S&P 500 constituents and
  so previously never got bars written for the report's market strip
- Switched to PEP 639 license metadata (`license-files`, dropped the
  redundant OSI trove classifier)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s manual mypy command now includes `tests`, matching
  justfile/CI/pre-commit
- The `create-pr` skill re-checks the working tree after `just check` so
  formatting changes cannot be left uncommitted behind a green checklist
